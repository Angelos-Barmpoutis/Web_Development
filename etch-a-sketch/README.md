# Etch a Sketch

This Web App is inspired by an assignment of The Odin Project. It's an old school drawing application with pixelated canvas. It's designed and coded 100% by me, Angelos Barmpoutis, with pure HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. No frameworks or pre-processors used for this small project.

Some of Etch-a-Sketch's functionality is:

-User can set brush to whatever color he likes out of all the colors available in the color palette

-There are four available pixel options to set his canvas' resolution: 256, 1024, 2916, 4900

-User can clear the canvas and start over again

-Fully responsive

-Custom made Logo

This web app works in a very simple but not sources-eficcient way. When the user sets the ammount of pixels, say X pixels, X divs are added to the parent div which is the sketchbook itself. So every pixel is a div. The coloring thing works by changing the background color of every pixel that get touched by the mouse.
