# Expanding Cards

- Fully Responsive

This project can stand as a hero/header componenent. It is an automatic image slider like carousel, but it can be manual as well, though this kind of functionality has to be done by uncommenting that particular part of the code.

The most challenging part of the porject was to make it responsive. I had to figure out a work-arround in order to make it fit to smaller devices. I accomplished that by stacking all the images together, setting their initial opacity to 0 and after that back to 1 when marked as active.

\*Edit: 30 minutes after pushing it to GitHub I figured out a better way to make it responsive. I changed the container's width from 'max-width: 1440px' to 'width: 100vw' and know images' slide effect is back.
